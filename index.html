      <p>My name is Hunter Harvell, and I'm a part-time web-developer learning how to code through the Univeristy of Washington.
          I'm currently working on devleloping the knowledge and the skills that will allow me to be the most effective and appealing web-developer I can be. I have an extensive background in 
          sales that I think will set me apart from a lot fo the other developers out there. I have a sense of what the retail environment is like, what the consumer looks for in a webpage when they
          visit it, and what a company can do to portray the culture and unique abilities of their business to set their company apart from all of the competition. I started my education at Texas A&M 
          University where I received a bachlor's degree in Business Management and Consulting. During the summer's of college, I would go home to work for a boat dealership that sold MasterCraft 
          wakeboard boats, and Crest pontoons. When I graduated I was offered a job selling boats full-time, quickly earning a top spot in the ranks and developing an understanding for sales that 
          no classroom can show you. Now it's time for a career change, and I'm working to expand my skills even further into the world of web technology and to find an employer who can use the tools 
          I already have and the ones I am learning right now.</p>
